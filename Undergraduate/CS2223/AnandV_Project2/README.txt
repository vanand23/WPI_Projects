Project 2 â€“ Finding the Closest Pair/Distance Between Multiple Points



How to run my code:



In the Python Shell:

1. Save the Python file to a location on your computer. 

2. Put in an array of points into an input file and save it as input.txt in the same folder as the python code file.

3. Go into the Python file and click on run module.

4. The Python Shell will pop up and would have compiled/run the code.

5. The result displayed is the answer of the closest distance between the points you inputted for the two algorithms, Brute_Force and Closest_Pair.



In the Command Line:

1. Save the Python file to a location on your computer.

2. Put in an array of points into an input file and save it as input.txt in the same folder as the python code file.

3. Go to the terminal and type in cd followed by the location of where your file is. For example, if my file was in a folder named Project-2 in Python-Projects in documents I would type in: cd /Users/vandanaanand/Documents/Python-Projects/Project-2 (this is also the same path next to restart when you run the python file in the IDLE shell)

4. Next, type in: python3 ./NameOfFile.py where you replace NameOfFile with the name of the actual file

5. This will compile/run the program and the result displayed is the answer of the closest distance between the points you inputted for the two algorithms, Brute_Force and Closest_Pair.



Below are the set of points I created to test my algorithms:

[(0, 0), (7, 6), (2, 20), (12, 5), (16, 16), (5, 8), (19, 7), (14, 22), (8, 19), (7, 29), (10, 11), (1, 13)]

[(0,1),(99,50),(153,22),(44,11)]

[(8,0), (0, 6), (0, 0), (10, 3), (4, 20), (2, 11), (15, 9), (7, 0), (19, 11)]
