Project 3 - The Knapsack Problem - Solved Three Ways



How to run my code:



In the Python Shell:

1. Save the Python file to a location on your computer. 
2. Put in a capacity (a number), weights (an array), and values (an array) into an input file and save it as input.txt in the same folder as the python code file.
3. Go into the Python file and click on run module.
4. The Python Shell will pop up and would have compiled/run the code.
5. You will be prompted to pick an option from the menu. Pick an algorithm (either Brute Force, Dynamic Programming, or Greedy Algorithm) you want to solve the knapsack problem using the corresponding number. Press 4 to exit the program. 
6. The result displayed is the answer of the algorithm and the time it took to run that algorithm. 



In the Command Line:

1. Save the Python file to a location on your computer. 
2. Put in a capacity (a number), weights (an array), and values (an array) into an input file and save it as input.txt in the same folder as the python code file.
3. Go to the terminal and type in cd followed by the location of where your file is. For example, if my file was in a folder named Project-3 in Python-Projects in documents I would type in: cd /Users/vandanaanand/Documents/Python-Projects/Project-3 (this is also the same path next to restart when you run the python file in the IDLE shell).
4. Next, type in: python3 ./NameOfFile.py where you replace NameOfFile with the name of the actual file.
5. This will compile/run the program. You will be prompted to pick an option from the menu. Pick an algorithm (either Brute Force, Dynamic Programming, or Greedy Algorithm) you want to solve the knapsack problem using the corresponding number. Press 4 to exit the program. 
6. The result displayed is the answer of the algorithm and the time it took to run that algorithm. 



Below are the sets of test cases I used to test my program:

Test case 1:      6
			[3, 2, 1, 4, 5]
			[25, 20, 15, 40, 50]

Test case 2:     100
			[30,42,53,15,23]
			[40,25,74,4,120]

Test case 3:       8 
			[1,5,3,4]
			[15,10,9,5]

where: line 1 is the capacity
            line 2 are the weights 
            line 3 are the values
