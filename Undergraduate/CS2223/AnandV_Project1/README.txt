               Project 1 â€“ Finding the Greatest Common Divisor

How to run my code:


In the Python Shell:

1.In the Python file, save it and click on run module.

2.The Python Shell will pop up and would have compiled/run the code. Then, a small blurb of what the program is will appear.

3.Next, the function will prompt the user to enter two numbers to find the GCD. It will ask for one number at a time so type in the first number and then the second number to get their GCD.

4. If the user enters an illegal input, the program will give the user two more chances to enter the correct inputs.

5. The program will give the user the answer and the time it took for the function to produce the result!


Command Prompt:

1. Save the python file to a location on your computer. 

2. Go to the terminal and type in cd followed by the location of where your file is. For example, if my file was in a folder named Python-Projects in documents I would type in: cd /Users/vandanaanand/Documents/Python-Projects (this is also the same path next to restart when you run the python file in the IDLE shell)

3. Next, type in: python ./NameOfFile.py where you replace NameOfFile with the name of the actual file

4. This will run the program and you can enter the numbers you wish to find the GCD of. Then you will get the results and the times of the functions!
