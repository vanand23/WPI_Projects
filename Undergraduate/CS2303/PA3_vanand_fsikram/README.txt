****SUMMARY****
Our project takes an arbitrary amount of input files, scans them,and counts the number of occurrences of each word in those files. After all input files are scanned, the program prints out a sorted list of the words in another file along with the number of occurrences of each word. As a way to organize our program, we are using a binary search tree.
The program is split into 3 distinct modules:
main.c : runs the main component of the function
tree.c: maintains binary tree order
string.c: works with certain string functions

****RUNNING THE PROGRAM****
In order to run the program, first we have to compile it. Once in the proper directory,use make to build the program. Then enter the the following in the command line:
./main.c nameOfOutputFile nameOfInputFile1 nameOfInputFile2…..nameOfInputFileN...
There must be more than or equal to 3 files in order for the program not to give you an error.
You will also get an error if your file is NULL.  In the make files we have the gcc  $(CFLAGS) -c tree/main/string.c to compile our program, and look for any changes made in the program. We have provided a few input files that  can be used for testing purposes. Speech.txt and newsArticle.txt can be found in our zip file. The output is below.


****PROBLEMS WE HAD****
We encountered a few problems along the way such as starting the string
manipulation function and how to incorporate that into the binary tree.
We also were confused on the memory allocation function but got that
clarified by the professor.

****ALGORITHM****
Vandana Anand and Fareya Ikram worked together on this project. The algorithm for this is the binary tree containing the left and right node which determines where to put the string found in the input file, and function for finding/removing punctuation, isolating a word and detecting white space, and putting the whole binary tree in an output file. 

****LOOP INVARIANT****
loop invariant: i is the argument in the command line
loop invariant: i is the string length and function converts word to lowercase

****OUTPUT FOR TEST CASES****
